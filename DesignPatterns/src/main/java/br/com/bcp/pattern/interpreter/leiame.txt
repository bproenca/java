In computer programming, the interpreter pattern is a particular design pattern. 
The interpreter pattern specifies how to evaluate sentences in a language. 
The basic idea is to have a class for each symbol (terminal or nonterminal) in a 
specialized computer language. The syntax tree of a sentence in the language is 
an instance of the composite pattern and is used to evaluate (interpret) the sentence.
